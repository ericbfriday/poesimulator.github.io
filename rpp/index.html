	<!-- Is it better to have tried and failed, than to have never tried at all? 
	Garfunkel and Oates seem to think so, but what do they know. 
	They don't experience crippling anxiety every time they think about trying. Clammy palms, cold sweat, a dreadful feeling of impending doom. 
	No one knows. No one sees. The words I want to say get lost and the moment slips by.
	All that remains is regret.

			  <h2>The experiment has ended</h2>
			</div>
<div class="md"><p>The Reddit Plays PoE experiment has been terminated due to lack of public interest. I tried to post an update on Reddit at r/pathofexile but instead got a warning and my post removed by the mods - apparently for "Self Promotion" of a twitch channel. It's a rather sad ending to what I hoped would be a long and entertaining run, and I can't say I'm not disappointed. Nonetheless, I'd like to thank everyone who participated, even the trolls and griefers, congratulations on making it to act 3, and I hope you were entertained, at least for a bit. </p><p>You can still watch VODs and selected clips from the run on <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/poesimulator/clips>Twitch here</a></p><p>You can also play my other PoE related content: my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8i6vz6/i_made_poe_simulator_a_browser_based_simulacrum/">Uber Elder Fight Simulator</a> and my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a70ums/i_made_a_browser_based_tinys_trial_crafting/">Tiny's Trial Crafting Simulator</a></p><p>Maybe one day, in a future league, I may return. Until then, this is u/fish312, signing off.</p>
