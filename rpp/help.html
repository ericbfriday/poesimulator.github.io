	<!-- Is it better to have tried and failed, than to have never tried at all? 
	Garfunkel and Oates seem to think so, but what do they know. 
	They don't experience crippling anxiety every time they think about trying. Clammy palms, cold sweat, a dreadful feeling of impending doom. 
	No one knows. No one sees. The words I want to say get lost and the moment slips by.
	All that remains is regret.

<div class="md"><p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://reddit.com/u/fish312">u/fish312</a>. You may remember me for my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8i6vz6/i_made_poe_simulator_a_browser_based_simulacrum/">Uber Elder Fight Simulator</a> and my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a70ums/i_made_a_browser_based_tinys_trial_crafting/">Tiny's Trial Crafting Simulator</a>.</p>

<p>Well, I'm back again this league, with another poorly thought-out browser based atrocity. Inspired by the <em>Twitch Plays Pokemon</em> experiment of yesteryear, I present to you... <strong>PoESimulator - Reddit Plays PoE</strong></p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Free to play, straight from your web browser yet again<br></li>
<li>Join the queue, and take turns to control the exile<br></li>
<li>Click within the display window to move during your turn<br></li>
<li>Flasks (1-5) and skill keys (QWERT) supported, also (I) for inventory and (P) for passive tree<br></li>
<li>Some parts of the screen are unclickable to prevent potential griefing<br></li>
<li>Running on a potato PC, because EC2 instances with graphics cards are expensive<br></li>
<li>SSF for the true exile experience<br></li>
<li>Mobile devices not officially supported<br></li>
</ul>

<p>How far will the collective minds of Reddit progress? How many exiles does it take to save Wraeclast? Let's find out.</p>
